RTSLib is a python library that provides an object API to the
LIO Linux SCSI Target as well as third-party target fabric modules written
for it and backend storage objects.

RTSLib was developed by Datera, Inc. (www.daterainc.com). It is useful for
developing 3rd-party applications, as well as serving as a foundation for
the Datera userspace tools.

For more information, see the rtslib API reference, available in html format
as a separate package.
